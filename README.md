# Script-to-Pepper PythonAnimator

HonorsThesis

## Setup

1. **Download Pycharm (requires JetBrains liscence)**
When setting up the enviornment, I used Pycharm, and found that to be the easier and most straightforward IDE. It manages the python interpreters well (have not tried any other IDEs to compare, ei. VisualStudio).
3. **Download Program**
This can be done by using "git clone ..." or by downloading the .zip.
5. **Open Project**
Click "Open" in under the "File" header. Then select the downloaded folder named "PythonParser". Now we are good to run the program.
